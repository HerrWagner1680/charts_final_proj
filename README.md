Final NYC+DA project - Google chart samples

This program lets you sample a number of chart types using Google Charts program.

Area, Bar, Step, Column, Line, Pie charts can be accessed when the first column of data is marked "string". The other type of charts can be seen when the data type select bar is marked "number".

Data can be uploaded via a Google Sheets URL.

Feel free to copy and paste the export code into your favorite text editor.
Once that exported HTML code is uploaded to a browser, it should act as an interactive chart.

####KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
* ctrl + r = shortcut to refresh chart window
* ctrl + p = shortcut to export chart to png image

NOTE: Google Sheets appears to have changed its JSON formating since I originally wrote this. I'm now in the process of updating the program so that it can glean data from Google Sheets once again.
